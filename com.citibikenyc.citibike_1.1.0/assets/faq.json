        "question": "What is Citi Bike?",
        "answer": "Citi Bike is NYC's bike share system. Bike sharing systems are fleets of specially designed, sturdy, very durable bikes that are locked into a network of docking stations located throughout the city. Citi Bike offers annual membership or short-term passes to provide access to the bikes anytime you want. Annual members enroll online and receive a key that they can use at any station to release a bike. For a 24-Hour or 7-Day Pass, sign up at any station kiosk with a credit or debit card. Citi Bikes can be returned to any station in the system, creating an efficient network with many possible start and end points."

        "question": "What if a station is full or has no bikes when I get there?",
        "answer": "Check real-time bike and dock availability by tapping the map on the bar below. Each pin identifies a station and shows the number of bikes and docks available. If you arrive at a full station, select &ldquo;Request Time Credit&rdquo; on the kiosk touchscreen and you will be offered an additional 15 minutes to reach a station with available docks."

        "question": "May I leave a Citi Bike unattended while I run an errand or lock it with my own bike lock somewhere?",
        "answer": "No! You are responsible for your bike while it is rented, from the moment it is unlocked to the moment it is securely docked. For example, if you leave your Citi Bike undocked while running errands and the bike is stolen, you are responsible for it and will be required to pay for its replacement (up to $1,000 plus administrative fees). The density of the Citi Bike system helps ensure that wherever you go in the program area, you'll always find a station within a few blocks of your destination. Once the Citi Bike is docked in a station, it is not your responsibility. So find a station nearby, dock the bike, wait for the green light to confirm the bike is secure, and run your errands with peace of mind."
