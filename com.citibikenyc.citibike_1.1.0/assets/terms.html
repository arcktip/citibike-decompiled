<p><b>Welcome to Citi Bike</b></p>

<p><span>Just a few terms &amp; conditions before 
you get started.</span></p>

<p>This document, together with any information contained in or supplied through the Service as defined below (the "Agreement"), is a contract between you ("you") and NYC Bike Share, LLC ("NYCBS") with respect to the terms and conditions associated with the use of the Citi Bike bike-share mobile application (the "Service"). Please read all of the following terms and conditions carefully before using the Service. By using or accessing the Service, you agree to all the terms and conditions stated in this Agreement. If, at any time, you do not or cannot agree to the terms of this Agreement, then you must stop accessing or using the Service and uninstall the application.</p>

<p><b>Modification of Terms of Use</b></p>

<p>NYCBS reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify or amend this Agreement, and to change, suspend, or discontinue the Service (including, but not limited to, the availability of any feature, database, or content), by sending you notice through the Service or via email. NYCBS may also impose limits on certain features and services or restrict your access to parts or all of the Service without notice or liability. It is your responsibility to check this Agreement periodically for all changes. Your continued use of the Service following the posting of any changes to this Agreement constitutes acceptance of those changes.</p>

<p><b>Use of the Service</b></p>

<p>
Subject to your full compliance with this Agreement, NYCBS grants you a limited and non-transferable right to access and use the Service to locate bicycles and stations used in bike-share systems supported by the Service. While NYCBS tries to provide you with the most accurate information at its disposal, all information provided through the Service is provided to you for your convenience only, and without any warranty of any kind regarding its accuracy, completeness, timeliness, availability, or quality. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, it is possible that the Service incorrectly lists available bicycles or docks and that such incorrect information causes you inconvenience or requires you to pay overtime fees. You do hereby release NYCBS from any and all liability resulting from such inconveniences or late fees by reason of your reliance on the information provided through the Service.  This Agreement is not the agreement that governs the use of the bike-share system. You must have entered into a separate agreement with NYCBS prior to using the bike-share system.</p>
