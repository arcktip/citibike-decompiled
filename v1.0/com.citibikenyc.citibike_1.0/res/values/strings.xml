    <string name="how_about_p1">Citi Bike is operated by NYC Bike Share LLC (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alta Bicycle Share). It features thousands of bikes in hundreds of stations throughout NYC.</string>
    <string name="how_about_p2">Citi Bike bicycles are durable, sturdy and regularly maintained. They can be rented using an Annual Member key or ride code that releases them from docking stations.</string>
    <string name="how_about_p3">Citi Bike is designed for short trips around New York, so that bikes can be returned to stations within the allotted 30-minute window (45-minute for Annual Members) and become available for other riders. It is not intended for longer, all-day usage.</string>

    <string name="safety_helmet_title">Wear A Helmet</string>
    <string name="safety_helmet_h2">Need a helmet? Here are two ways to get your own:</string>
    <string name="safety_helmet_p1">Citi Bike encourages you to wear a helmet when you ride. Doing so can reduce the risk of head injury in the event of a crash while bicycling.</string>
    <string name="safety_helmet_p2">Always buckle the chin strap, and replace your helmet after any crash or whenever you see signs of damage.</string>
    <string name="safety_helmet_p3">Buy a helmet from a local bike shop or helmet retailer. Select the “Bike Shops” layer on the Citi Bike map to find the nearest retailer. Along with their Citi Bike key, every Annual Member receives a coupon good for $10 off one helmet at any bike shop in NYC.</string>
    <string name="safety_helmet_p4">Receive a free helmet and fitting from the Department of Transportation. NYC DOT fits and gives away the official New York City bicycle helmet at events throughout the city. Call 311 to schedule a fitting.</string>
    <string name="safety_predictable_title">Be Predictable</string>
    <string name="safety_predictable_h1">The more predictably you ride, the safer you are.</string>
    <string name="safety_predictable_p1">Don’t weave in and out of traffic</string>
    <string name="safety_predictable_p2">Use hand signals to let drivers and other cyclists know where you’re going</string>
    <string name="safety_predictable_p3">Ride about 4 feet away from parked cars, avoiding “the door zone”</string>
    <string name="safety_predictable_p4">Don’t ride distracted. It is illegal to ride with both headphones in.</string>
    <string name="safety_predictable_p5">Use your bell to alert drivers, pedestrians, and other cyclists of your presence</string>
    <string name="safety_predictable_p6">Use marked bike lanes or paths when available, except when marking turns or when it is unsafe to do so. If the road is too narrow for a bicycle and a car to travel safely side by side, you have the right to ride in the middle of the travel lane.</string>
    <string name="safety_predictable_p7">Bicycling is permitted on all main and local streets throughout New York City, even when no designated route exists.</string>

    <string name="safety_preride_check_p1">NYC Bike Share maintains every bike to help ensure they are in good condition and working properly. It’s always a good idea to give the bike a look over before starting a ride.</string>
    <string name="safety_preride_check_p2">If a bike isn’t working properly, lock it back into any Citi Bike dock, press the wrench button on the dock and unlock a different bike.</string>
    <string name="safety_preride_check_p3">Check the following before you set off:</string>
    <string name="safety_preride_check_p4">Citi Bike seats are easily adjustable. Just release the clamp on the side of the seat post, raise or lower the seat to your preferred height, align the black line in the center and re-tighten the clamp. Make sure the clamp is tight and the seat can’t twist or sink. Typically, a seat is at the right height when you can almost fully straighten your legs when pedaling.</string>
    <string name="safety_preride_check_p5">Push each tire hard against a curb or the ground. If you can flatten it, it needs air.</string>
    <string name="safety_preride_check_p6">Lift each wheel up and give it a slow spin (spin the back wheel forward so the pedals don’t move). Check that the wheel spins freely and doesn’t rub against the brake pads or anything else.</string>
    <string name="safety_preride_check_p7">Turn each wheel slowly and look for cuts, bulges or bubbles in the tire.</string>
    <string name="safety_preride_check_p8">Squeeze both brake levers to check that brakes are functional and feel strong.</string>
